# Minecraft Editor Script Box

This sample makes it easy to experiment with JavaScript code in the context of the Minecraft Edutir. Just add your code in the function at ScriptBox.ts, and this sample will add some infrastructure around it to make it easy to run that sample in within the editor experience.

## Prerequisites

**Install Node.js tools, if you haven't already**

We're going to use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) to get more tools to make the process of building our project easier.

Visit [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org).

Download the version with "LTS" next to the number and install it. (LTS stands for Long Term Support, if you're curious.) In the Node.js Windows installer, accept the installation defaults. You do not need to install any additional tools for Native compilation.

**Install Visual Studio Code, if you haven't already**

Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install Visual Studio Code.

## Getting Started

1. Use npm to install dependent modules:

   ```powershell
   npm i
   ```

1. Use this shortcut command to open the project in Visual Studio Code:

   ```powershell
   code .
   ```

### Chapter 2. Let's test the parts of our project

Within the root folder (script-box) of this sample, run this command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Run this one, too.

```powershell
npm run local-deploy
```

Create an addon file to share.

```powershell
npm run mcaddon
```
