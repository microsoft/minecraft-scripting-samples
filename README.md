- [ts-starter](ts-starter/README.md) - A starter project that lets you use TypeScript, alongside a tutorial on how to use more `@minecraft/server` APIs.
- [ts-starter-complete-cotta](ts-starter-complete-cotta/README.md) - A completed version of the `ts-starter` tutorial, featuring the Break the Cotta simple arena game.
- [howto-gallery](howto-gallery/README.md) - A set of small code snippets that can be played back within the game.
- [build-challenge](build-challenge/README.md) - A more complex starter script map with the ability to form teams that build structures, that can then be voted on.
- [custom-components](custom-components/README.md) - An addon using block and item custom components to add a new strawberry crop and watering tool.
